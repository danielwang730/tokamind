"""
Loss package for the Multi-Modal Transformer.

This package provides a composable loss system consisting of individual loss terms combined by a
``LossAggregator``. Each term is an instance of ``BaseLoss`` and declares what batch fields it needs.

Available loss terms
--------------------
• ``EmbedMSELoss``        — MSE in embedding (coeff) space. Default term, no decoding required.
• ``NativeSparseMSELoss`` — MSE in native standardized space. Requires decoders and ``keep_output_native=True``.
• ``GradShafranovResidualLoss`` — Grad-Shafranov residual in destandardized native space.

Config schema (``train.loss``)
-------------------------------
Old format (single embed-MSE term, still supported)::

    loss:
      output_weights: {}   # optional per-signal weights

New format (explicit terms)::

    loss:
      output_weights: {}   # optional per-signal weights applied inside each term
      terms:
        - type: embed_mse
          weight: 1.0
          outputs:
            include: [output_a, output_b]
        - type: native_sparse_mse
          weight: 0.5
          outputs:
            exclude: [output_a, output_b]
        - type: grad_shafranov_residual
          weight: 0.1
          rhs_input:
            origin: predicted_j_tor
            calculation_method: GS_operator  # REMARK: Only used when "built" origin is used. TODO: Improve wording.
          outputs:
            include: [equilibrium-psi, equilibrium-j_tor]

Notes
-----
For orthonormal encoders (DCT/FPCA) using all coefficients, coeff-space MSE and native-space MSE differ only by a
constant factor ``K / N``:

    native_MSE ≈ (K / N) * coeff_MSE

where K = number of coefficients and N = number of native samples. This implementation does **not** apply the K/N
scaling; losses are expressed in their respective space's MSE units.
